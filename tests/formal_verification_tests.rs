//! Formal Verification Tests for SwapTrade Contract
//! 
//! This module implements property-based testing to verify critical invariants:
//! - Asset Conservation: Total supply = sum of user balances
//! - Authorization Invariant: Only authorized parties can modify state
//! - State Monotonicity: Version and timestamp never decrease
//! - Fee Bounds: Fees always within [0%, 1%] of transaction amount
//! - AMM Invariant: Constant product formula holds
//! 
//! Run with `cargo test formal_verification` to execute all property tests.
//! Run with `cargo test formal_verification -- --nocapture` to see detailed output.
